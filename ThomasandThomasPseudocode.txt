series of if statements to check isHillDwarf, hasToughFeat, and averagedHp, and
calculate characterHp based on them
private int conModifier
if isHillDwarf
characterHp += characterLevel
if hasToughFeat
characterHp += characterLevel * 2
if averagedHp
check dictionary for hitdie, get average rounded up (8 = 4.5 = 5)
else
pick a number at random from a range of 1 - hitdie
debug log that gives the information after calculations
(would include characterName, characterLevel, characterClass, if hill dwarf or not,
if tough feat or not, rolled or averaged hp, and return final hp count)
